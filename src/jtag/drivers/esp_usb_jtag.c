/*
Holy Crap, it's protocol documentation, and it's even vendor-provided!

A device that speaks this protocol has two endpoints intended for JTAG debugging: one
OUT for the host to send encoded commands to, one IN from which the host can read any read
TDO bits. The device will also respond to vendor-defined interface requests on ep0.

The main communication method is over the IN/OUT endpoints. The commands that are expected
on the OUT endpoint are one nibble wide and are processed high-nibble-first, low-nibble-second,
and in the order the bytes come in. Commands are defined as follows:

    bit     3   2    1    0
CMD_CLK   [ 0   cap  tdi  tms  ]
CMD_RST   [ 1   0    0    srst ]
CMD_FLUSH [ 1   0    1    0    ]
CMD_RSV   [ 1   0    1    1    ]
CMD_REP   [ 1   1    R1   R0   ]

CMD_CLK sets the TDI and TMS lines to the value of `tdi` and `tms` and lowers, then raises, TCK. If
`cap` is 1, the value of TDO is captured and can be retrieved over the IN endpoint. The bytes read from
the IN endpoint specifically are these bits, with the lowest it in every byte captured first and the
bytes returned in the order the data in them was captured. The durations of TCK being high / low can
be set using the VEND_JTAG_SETDIV vendor-specific interface request.

CMD_RST controls the SRST line; as soon as the command is processed, the SRST line will be set
to the value of `srst`.

CMD_FLUSH flushes the IN endpoint; zeroes will be added to the amount of bits in the endpoint until
the payload is a multiple of bytes, and the data is offered to the host. If the IN endpoint has
no data, this effectively becomes a no-op; the endpoint won't send any 0-byte payloads.

CMD_RSV is reserved for future use.

CMD_REP repeats the last command that is not CMD_REP. The amount of times a CMD_REP command will
re-execute this command is (r1*2+r0)<<(2*n), where n is the amount of previous repeat commands executed
since the command to be repeated.

An example for CMD_REP: Say the host queues:
1. CMD_CLK - This will execute one CMD_CLK.
2. CMD_REP with r1=0 and r0=1 - This will execute 1. another (0*2+1)<<(2*0)=1 time.
3. CMD_REP with r1=1 and r0=0 - This will execute 1. another (1*2+0)<<(2*1)=4 times.
4. CMD_REP with r1=0 and r0=1 - This will execute 1. another (0*2+1)<<(2*2)=8 time.
5. CMD_FLUSH - This will flush the IN pipeline.
6. CMD_CLK - This will execute one CMD_CLK
7. CMD_REP with r1=1 and r0=0 - This will execute 6. another (1*2+0)<<(2*0)=2 times.
8. CMD_FLUSH - This will flush the IN pipeline.

Note that the net effect of the repetitions is that command 1 is executed (1+1+4+8=) 14 times and
command 6 is executed (1+2=) 3 times.

Note that the device only has a fairly limited amount of endpoint RAM. It's probably best to keep
an eye on the amount of bytes that are supposed to be in the IN endpoint and grab those before stuffing
more commands into the OUT endpoint: the OUT endpoint will not accept any more commands (writes will
time out) when the IN endpoint buffers are all filled up.

The device also supports some vendor-specific interface requests. These requests are sent as control
transfers on endpoint 0 to the JTAG endpoint. Note that these commands bypass the data in the OUT
endpoint; if timing is important, it's important that this endpoint is empty. This can be done by
e.g sending one CMD_CLK capturing TDI, then one CMD_FLUSH, then waiting until the bit appears on the
IN endpoint.

01000000b     VEND_JTAG_SETDIV [divide] interface 0       None

VEND_JTAG_SETDIV indirectly controls the speed of the TCK clock. The value written here is the length
of a TCK cycle, in ticks of the adapters base clock. Both the base clock value as well as the
minimum and maximum divider can be read from the jtag capabilities descriptor, as explained
below. Note that this should not be set to a value outside of the range described there,
otherwise results are undefined.

VEND_JTAG_SETIO can be controlled to directly set the IO pins. The format of [iobits] normally is
{11'b0, srst, trst, tck, tms, tdi}
Note that the first 11 0 bits are reserved for future use, current hardware ignores them.

VEND_JTAG_GETTDO returns one byte, of which bit 0 indicates the current state of the TDO input.
Note that other bits are reserved for future use and should be ignored.

To describe the capabilities of the JTAG adapter, a specific descriptor (0x20) can be retrieved.
The format of the descriptor documented below. The descriptor works in the same fashion as USB
descriptors: a header indicating the version and total length followed by descriptors with a
specific type and size. Forward compatibility is guaranteed as software can skip over an unknown
descriptor.

between the two.

Note: If the JTAG device has larger buffers than endpoint-size-plus-a-bit, we should have some kind
of caps header to assume this. If no such caps exist, assume a minimum (in) buffer of endpoint size + 4.
