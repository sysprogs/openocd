.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B OpenOCD
is an on\-chip debugging, in\-system programming and boundary\-scan
testing tool for various microcontrollers and other embedded devices.
.PP
Various different types of debug adapters as well as transport protocols like
JTAG and SWD are supported by OpenOCD, please check the \fIopenocd\fR info page
for the complete list.
.PP
User interaction is realized through a telnet command line interface,
a gdb (the GNU debugger) remote protocol server, and a simplified RPC
connection that can be used to interface with OpenOCD's Jim Tcl engine.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B "\-f, \-\-file <filename>"
This is a shortcut for a \fB\-c "[script \fI<filename>\fB]"\fR
command, using a search path to load the configuration file
.IR <filename> .
In order to specify multiple config files, you can use multiple
.B \-\-file
arguments. If no such \fB\-c\fR
options are included, the first config file
.B openocd.cfg
in the search path will be used.
.TP
.B "\-s, \-\-search <dirname>"
Add
.I <dirname>
to the search path used for config files and scripts.
The search path begins with the current directory,
then includes these additional directories before other
components such as the standard OpenOCD script libraries.
.TP
.B "\-d, \-\-debug <debuglevel>"
Set debug level. Possible values are:
.br
.RB "  * " 0 " (errors)"
.br
.RB "  * " 1 " (warnings)"
.br
.RB "  * " 2 " (informational messages)"
.br
.RB "  * " 3 " (debug messages)"
.br
The default level is
.BR 2 .
.TP
.B "\-l, \-\-log_output <filename>"
Redirect log output to the file
.IR <filename> .
Per default the log output is printed on
.BR stderr .
.TP
.B "\-c, \-\-command <cmd>"
Add the command
.I <cmd>
to a list of commands executed on server startup.
Note that you will need to explicitly invoke
.I init
if the command requires access to a target or flash.
