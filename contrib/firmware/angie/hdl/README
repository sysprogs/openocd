This is the source code of Nanoxplore USB-JTAG Adapter Angie's bitstream.
This bitstream is for the "xc6slx9-2tqg144" Spartan-6 Xilinx FPGA.

To generate this bitstream, you need to install Xilinx ISE Webpack 14.7
You will need to give the ISE software path : export XILINX_HOME=path/to/ise/sw
Please set the enviromnent first by executing the ". ./set_env.sh"

All you have to do now is to write your vhd and constrains codes.

One all is setup, you can use the make commands:
    make compile : to compile your (.vhd & .ucf) files in the "src" directory
    A directory named "build" will be created, which contains all the generated
    files including the bitstream file.

    make clean : to delete the build directory.
